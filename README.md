Developer's notes: 

     The current version of the game only supports single player gameplay and is limited in functionality. It is this developers wish to add an internet multiplayer option, strengthen the AI logic, and give players the ability to increase the size of the game board in the future. However, all good things must wait. In the meantime, please enjoy a game of tic-tac-toe and let me know what you think. A special thanks everyone who's assisted me with this project.
